from fastapi import APIRouter


router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/health")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "ok"}





@router.get("/health")
That line registers the function as a handler for HTTP requests.
So FastAPI learns:
“When a GET request comes to /health, call health_check.”
health_check exists to answer one question:
“Is the application running and able to respond?”

#understanding main.py


 FastAPI() creates the whole application object
